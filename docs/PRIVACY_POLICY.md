# Privacy Policy for Kuna

*Last updated: 21 August 2025*

Kuna ("the App") is a third-party client for **Vikunja**, an open-source
task management system. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles
your information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Information Collection and Use

-   **No account is created with Kuna itself.** The App connects
    directly to your chosen Vikunja server.\
-   **Account data (such as email, username, password, and tasks)** is
    stored on the Vikunja server you connect to, not by Kuna.\
-   **Kuna does not operate its own backend.** All data you see in the
    App comes from, and is saved to, your selected server.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Stored on Your Device

-   The App stores cached data (such as task lists and project
    information) locally on your device for performance and offline
    use.\
-   This data never leaves your device except when syncing with your
    chosen server.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Analytics

-   Kuna may collect **anonymous usage statistics** (such as feature
    usage and error reports) to improve the App.\
-   You can **opt out of analytics at any time** in the App's settings.\
-   No personal task data, server data, or login details are included in
    analytics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Third-Party Services

-   Kuna relies on the **Vikunja API**. The privacy of your data depends
    on the server you choose. Please review your server administrator's
    privacy policy if you are not running your own server.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Security

-   Communication with your server is encrypted using HTTPS (if
    supported by the server).\
-   Kuna does not store your password in plain text; credentials are
    saved securely in the system keychain.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Children's Privacy

Kuna is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not
knowingly collect personal information from them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Your Rights

Because Kuna does not store or control your data, **requests to delete
or export your data must be directed to the administrator of your
Vikunja server**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Changes will be
reflected in the App and on its App Store listing.
